Extracting the carrying object.
We will create an actor with collision box to extract.

Method:
First create an actor called FPSExtraction
Then create a box collision in it through cpp.
Add following to the Header file (Under protected).

	UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, Category = "Components")
	UBoxComponent* OverlapComp;



Now go to header file and add the following 
	
	#include "Components/BoxComponent.h"

Then go to the constructor and add the following

	OverlapComp = CreateDefaultSubobject<UBoxComponent>(TEXT("OverlapComp"));	// create the box
	OverlapComp->SetCollisionEnabled(ECollisionEnabled::QueryOnly);			// set collision on spatial queries (raycasts, sweeps, and overlaps).
	OverlapComp->SetCollisionResponseToAllChannels(ECR_Ignore);			// Ignore all collisions
	OverlapComp->SetCollisionResponseToChannel(ECC_Pawn, ECR_Overlap);		// Setting collision to only Pawn overlap
	OverlapComp->SetBoxExtent(FVector(200.0f));					//
	RootComponent = OverlapComp;							// Making it root component

Now we need an event for overlap detection. Alternative to actor notifybeginoverlap is
add the following

	OverlapComp->OnComponentBeginOverlap.AddDynamics(this, &AFPSExtractionZone::HandleOverlap); //HandleOverlap is a function that is not yet declared.

HandleOverlap function is not declared. So declare the function in header file as follows.

	UFUNCTION()
	void HandleOverlap(UPrimitiveComponent* OverlappedComponent, AActor* OtherActor, UPrimitiveComponent* OtherComp, int32 OtherBodyIndex, bool bFromSweep, const FHitResult & SweepResult);

the parametes can be found from the defenition of OnComponentBeginOverlap in the premitivecomponents.h file. (right click and go to OnComponentBeginOverlap definitions. it will open premitivecomponents.h file) (remove the commas)

now in the cpp file create the new definitions of function HandleOverlap as follows(just to see the function work at the moment)
	void AFPSExtractionZone::HandleOverlap(UPrimitiveComponent * OverlappedComponent, AActor * OtherActor, UPrimitiveComponent * OtherComp, int32 OtherBodyIndex, bool bFromSweep, const FHitResult & SweepResult)
	{
		UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("Overlapped with extraction zone"));
	}
